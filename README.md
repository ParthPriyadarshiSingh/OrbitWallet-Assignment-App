# OrbitWallet-Assignment App

This is a React Native project built using Expo. I have utilised the new Flashlist component from shopify to render multiple lists of items containing text and image. The list on the home screen is an infinite list, implemented using optimal techniques. These lists are highly performant, even on low end devices, all because of the ultimate list component called Flashlist.

## Third-Party libraries used

1. React Navigation
2. @shopify/flash-list
